# FDK Public Service Harvester

This application provides an API for public services harvested from different sources.

For a broader understanding of the systemâ€™s context, refer to
the [architecture documentation](https://github.com/Informasjonsforvaltning/architecture-documentation) wiki. For more
specific context on this application, see the **Harvesting** subsystem section.

The harvest process is triggered by messages from RabbitMQ with the routing key `publicservice.*.HarvestTrigger`, a
message will call the method `initiateHarvest` in the class `HarvesterActivity`. The actual harvest will start when
`activitySemaphore` has an available permit, when there are no available permits all messages will be queued by the
semaphore.

The body of the trigger message has 3 relevant parameters:

- `dataSourceId` - Triggers the harvest of a specific source from fdk-harvest-admin
- `publisherId` - Triggers the harvest of all sources for the specified organization number.
- `forceUpdate` - Indicates that the harvest should be performed, even when no changes are detected in the source

A triggered harvest will download all relevant sources from fdk-harvest-admin, download everything from the source and
try to read it as a RDF graph via a jena Model. If the source is successfully parsed as a jena Model it will be compared
to the last harvest of the same source. The harvest process will continue if the source is not isomorphic to the last
harvest or `forceUpdate` is true.

The actual harvest process will first find services, resources with the type `cpsv:PublicService` or `cpsvno:Service`,
and catalogs, resources with the type `dcat:Catalog`, blank node services and catalogs will be ignored. A catalog will
also be generated from data about the source from fdk-harvest-admin, any services in the source that is not part of any
catalog, indicated by the predicate `dcatno:containsService`, will be added to this catalog.
When all catalogs and services have been found a recursive function will create a graph with every contained triple for
all catalogs and services.

The process will save metadata for both services and catalogs:

- `uri` - The IRI for the resource, is used as the database id
- `fdkId` - The UUID used for the resource used in the context of FDK, is a generated hash of the uri if nothing else is
  set.
- `isPartOf` - Only relevant for services, is the uri of the catalog it belongs to.
- `removed` - Only relevant for services, is set to true if the event has been removed from the source.
- `issued` - The timestamp of the first time the resource was harvested
- `modified` - The timestamp of the last time a harvest of the resource found changes in the resource graph

All blank nodes will be [skolemized](https://www.w3.org/wiki/BnodeSkolemization) in the resource graphs.

When all sources from the trigger has been processed a new rabbit message will be published with the routing key
`public_services.harvested`, the message body will be a list of harvest reports, one report for each source from
fdk-harvest-admin.

When the rabbit message has been published the semaphore permit is released and a new harvest trigger can be processed.
